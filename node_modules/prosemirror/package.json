  "readme": "# ProseMirror\n\nThis is a well-behaved what-you-see-is-what-you-mean editor based on\ncontentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and\ncustomizable document models.\n\nThe project page, which has a number of demos, is\n[prosemirror.net](http://prosemirror.net).\n\n**NOTE:** This project is in *BETA* stage. It isn't well-tested yet,\nthere are no NPM modules yet, and the APIs may change at will for the\ntime being. You are welcome to use it, but you can't expect it to be\nstable or mature yet.\n\nThis code is released under an [MIT-style\nlicense](https://github.com/prosemirror/prosemirror/tree/master/LICENSE).\nThere's a [forum](http://discuss.prosemirror.net) for general\ndiscussion and support requests, and the [Github bug\ntracker](https://github.com/prosemirror/prosemirror/issues) is the\nplace to report issues.\n\nDocumentation can be found on [the\nwebsite](http://prosemirror.net/doc/manual.html).\n\n## Structure\n\nThis software is written as a collection of ES6 modules. Since JS\nengines don't really run ES6 yet, it has to be compiled to ES5 to\nactually run. You can use `npm run dist` to compile a copy of the\nsource tree under the `dist` directory. You would then typically use\n[Browserify](http://browserify.org/),\n[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), or something similar to package\nup the modules you need for the browser.\n\nHere's a rough overview of the source directories:\n\n```\nsrc/\n  model/      The document model\n  transform/  Operations on the document model\n  edit/       The editor\n  collab/     Collaborative editing module\n  inputrules/ Magic input (-- → —) module\n  convert/    Document conversion code to and from DOM, HTML, and Markdown\n  menu/       Menu UI modules\n```\n\nMost of these contain an `index.js` file that exposes the module's\ncontent as a flat object (i.e. no attempts are made to make the 'main'\nthing in a module the exported value or default export).\n\n## Run the demo\n\nInstall [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).\n\nInside the project directory, install the project's node dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nBuild the demo, which will recompile files on change\n\n```bash\nnpm run demo\n```\n\nOpen `demo/index.html` in your browser\n",
